Artifactdle is a Wordle-style game for guessing artifact sets from Genshin Impact. You pick an artifact set from the list of sets, and get guess feedback based on the set's region, 2pc and 4pc buffs and release version, with the aim of guessing the randomly selected artifact set within five guesses. Built with React, Tailwind and Framer Motion, the project is heavily inspired by the already exisitng [Genshindle](https://genshindle.com), but for artifact sets.

## How To Play

1. A random, unknown artifact set is selected.
2. Type and select an artifact set from the given list.
3. The game compares your guess and tells you which attributes (name, region, 2pc buff, 4pc buff & release version) are a match or close match to the answer.
4. Keep guessing until either you guess the correct artifact set or hit 5 guesses.
5. Try to build up a streak of wins and aim for a high score.
